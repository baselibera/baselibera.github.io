Hi, this site can help to jot some information about technologies and how to manage them.
I'm a develper. Often I play an architect role defining and designing software. To do this I need to know how many technologies is possible to choose best of them to resolve my requirements. 

So I decide to investigate how Octopress work. More I had found it interesting how the Octopress software stack interact in a editing/publishing lifecycle process.

I work mainly with enterprise architecture and develop software based on Java platform. In this field I'comfortable in this field. Here I'm trying technologies new to me:

- Ruby and its gems 
- Octopress
- Git
- GitHub Pages 
- Many interacting frontend technologies

So what better opportunity to use these same technologies to take notes on them.
I hope this is useful for me and that I extend it to my main [blog site](www.interconnessi.net) actually working with Wordpress CMS.
